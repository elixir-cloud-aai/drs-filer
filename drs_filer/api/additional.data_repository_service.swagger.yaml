          The checksum of the `DrsObject`. At least one checksum must be provided.

          For blobs, the checksum is computed over the bytes in the blob.


          For bundles, the checksum is computed over a sorted concatenation of the
          checksums of its top-level contained objects (not recursive, names not included).
          The list of checksums is sorted alphabetically (hex-code) before concatenation
          and a further checksum is performed on the concatenated checksum value.


          For example, if a bundle contains blobs with the following checksums:

          md5(blob1) = 72794b6d

          md5(blob2) = 5e089d29


          Then the checksum of the bundle is:

          md5( concat( sort( md5(blob1), md5(blob2) ) ) )

          = md5( concat( sort( 72794b6d, 5e089d29 ) ) )

          = md5( concat( 5e089d29, 72794b6d ) )

          The value (e.g. `sha-256`) SHOULD be listed as `Hash Name String` in the https://www.iana.org/assignments/named-information/named-information.xhtml#hash-alg[IANA Named Information Hash Algorithm Registry].
          Other values MAY be used, as long as implementors are aware of the issues discussed in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6920#section-9.4[RFC6920].


          GA4GH may provide more explicit guidance for use of non-IANA-registered algorithms in the future.
          Until then, if implementors do choose such an algorithm (e.g. because it's implemented by their storage provider), they SHOULD use an existing
          standard `type` value such as `md5`, `etag`, `crc32c`, `trunc512`, or `sha1`.
